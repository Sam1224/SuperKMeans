# Benchmarking

We provide a set of benchmarks to reproduce every result of our VLDB'26 publication. To compile them, you need to add the following CMake variable:

```bash
cmake . -DSKMEANS_COMPILE_BENCHMARKS=ON
```

## Prerequisites (CPU)

### OpenMP and a BLAS implementation 
Check [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#installing-openmp). A proper BLAS implementation is **EXTREMELY** important for performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A proper BLAS implementation is **EXTREMELY** important for performance. The pre-installed BLAS in your Linux distribution and OpenBLAS installed via `apt` are **SLOW**.

### FAISS 
Our CMake will install FAISS for you. However, you need to set the proper optimization flag. For example, with a machine that supports AVX512 you shall do:
```bash
cmake .  -DFAISS_OPT_LEVEL="avx512" -DSKMEANS_COMPILE_BENCHMARKS=ON
make benchmarks
```

Some common flags:
- `avx512_spr`: Intel Granite Rapids, Intel Emerald Rapids, Intel Sapphire Rapids.
- `avx512`: Intel Ice Lake, Intel Sky Lake, AMD Zen 5 (Turin), AMD Zen 4 (Genoa).
- `avx2`: Intel Haswell, AMD Zen 3 (Milan), AMD Zen 2 (Rome).
- `sve`: AWS Graviton 4, AWS Graviton 3.
- `generic`:  AWS Graviton 2, Apple M1-M5.

You can find more information about FAISS installation [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

### Scikit-Learn
You should create a Python `venv` and install `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `h5py`:
```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy scikit-learn h5py
```

## Datasets Preparation

Our benchmarks do not yet support using custom datasets. We have made our datasets publicly downloadable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f76UCrU52N2wToGMFg9ir1MY8ZocrN34?usp=sharing). Download them into `/benchmarks/data/`. See below the **List of Datasets** to see the mapping of IDs to `.hdf5` files.

Once you have downloaded a dataset, you have to prepare it for the benchmarks. The script is ready for using `uv`, or you can also run it as a plain Python script with your `venv`. 
```bash
cd benchmarks
uv run --script setup_data.py [--data-dir <data_dir>] <dataset> 

# or using a `venv` with numpy, scikit-learn, and h5py
python setup_data.py [--data-dir <data_dir>] <dataset> 
```

- [Optional]`--data-dir`: The directory in which you downloaded our raw `.hdf5` file.
- `dataset`: The identifier of the dataset you want to use for benchmarking. You can check the identifiers in the collapsible list below:

For `cohere`, the script will download the data for you.

### Installing `uv`
We use `uv` to simplify dependency installation. You can install it by doing:
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Compiling and Running Benchmarks

Compile the benchmarks:
```bash
cmake . -DSKMEANS_COMPILE_BENCHMARKS=ON -DFAISS_OPT_LEVEL="<opt_level>"
make benchmarks
cd benchmarks
```

We have a handful of `.sh` scripts in `./benchmarks/` to reproduce the experiments described in our publication. Below, you will find each of them and how to run them. 

## Benchmarks List

### End-to-End
Runs clustering with Super K-Means, FAISS K-Means, and Scikit-Learn K-Means with the number of clusters fixed to $k= 4*\sqrt{N}$, and the number of iterations fixed to 25, for instance, for 1M vectors, $k=4000$. 

**Output**: CSV file in `./benchmarks/results/default/end_to_end.csv` reporting construction time in milliseconds of each algorithm, and the `recall` that the centroids would yield when used for vector search tasks.

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**:
```sh
./end_to_end.sh -b .. -p <python_path> <dataset1_id> <dataset2_id> <datasetn_id>
```

- `python_path`: Path to your Python binaries
- `dataset_id`: Identifier of the dataset you want to benchmark. You can run benchmarks across multiple datasets at once by separating the dataset IDs with spaces.


### Varying $k$
Runs clustering with Super K-Means, FAISS K-Means, and Scikit-Learn K-Means using different numbers of clusters per dataset (100, 1K, 10K, and 100K), and the number of iterations fixed to 25.

**Output**: CSV file in `./benchmarks/results/default/varying_k.csv` reporting construction time in milliseconds of each algorithm.

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**:
```sh
./varying_k.sh -b .. -p <python_path> <dataset_id>
```

### Early Termination
Runs clustering with Super K-Means, FAISS K-Means, and Scikit-Learn K-Means with the number of clusters fixed to $k= 4*\sqrt{N}$. In FAISS, we stop at 10 iterations. In Scikit-Learn, we stop at 300 iterations, but activating the default `tolerance` parameter for early stopping. Finally, for Super K-Means, we use **Early Termination by Recall**, and try different tolerance levels.

**Output**: CSV file in `./benchmarks/results/default/early_termination.csv` reporting construction time in milliseconds of each algorithm and the `recall` that the centroids would yield when used for vector search tasks.

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**:
```sh
./early_termination.sh -b .. -p <python_path> <dataset_id>
```

### Sampling
Runs clustering with Super K-Means using different percentages of sampling (from 1% to 100%), with the number of clusters fixed to $k= 4*\sqrt{N}$, and the number of iterations fixed to 25. 

**Output**: CSV file in `./benchmarks/results/default/sampling.csv` reporting construction time in milliseconds of each algorithm and the `recall` that the centroids would yield when used for vector search tasks.

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**:
```sh
./sampling.sh -b .. <dataset_id>
```


### Quality per Iteration
Runs clustering with Super K-Means using different iterations (from 1 to 10), with the number of clusters fixed to $k= 4*\sqrt{N}$.

**Output**: CSV file in `./benchmarks/results/default/pareto.csv` reporting construction time in milliseconds of each algorithm and the `recall` that the centroids would yield when used for vector search tasks.

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**:
```sh
./pareto.sh -b .. <dataset_id>
```

### Profiling

**Output**: Console logs with runtime and profiling information. These logs are non-persistent. 

**Command (assuming `pwd` is `./benchmarks`)**

```sh
make ad_hoc_superkmeans.out
./ad_hoc_superkmeans <dataset_id>
```
